<a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/salesforce_release_notes.htm" target="_blank">Summer '15 Release Notes</a> are out, so it's time to take a tour around some of the coolest new features -- Highlights in bold!

> At the time of publication, this is only a "preview" of the release, and the features below may or may not actually be delivered.

### Salesforce1 
* <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/rn_mobile_salesforce1_newfeat_actionbar_customization.htm" target="_blank">**Customize Actions in the Salesforce1 Action Bar**</a>

	This essentially differentiates the desktop Publisher bar on the Chatter feed from the Salesforce1 Action bar, although the actions are inherited from there.

* <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/rn_chatter_feeds_edit_posts.htm" target="_blank">Console Tab Navigation</a>
	
	You can know bookmark and pin tabs on the screen – With the other 2 features above, makes it even harder to ignore how powerful the console is...
	<img src="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_console_bookmarks.png" alt="Salesforce1 Console Tab Nav" width="1000"/>
	
	Based just on the volume of new features & updates above, looks like Service is definitely on Salesforce's mind for this release...

### Chatter
* <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/rn_chatter_feeds_edit_posts.htm" target="_blank">**Edit Feed Posts and Comments**</a>

	You can now edit your own Chatter posts after they are published, and Sys Admins can edit other users' as well.
* Two-Way Sync Between Content Files & Chatter Files
* Manage Which Custom Object Records Can Be Added to Groups
* Report on Record Feeds
* Redesigned User Digest (Beta)
* Improved Profile Photo Upload Time

### Process Builder & Visual Workflow
* Populate Multi-Select Picklists
* Access Global Variables
* Removed 12 Hour Flow & Process Delete Wait Time (my personal favorite :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:)
* Use Formulas in Process Builder
* Define Filter Criteria When Updating Records in Process Builder
* Better Process Management UI
* Better Field Selector in Process Builder
* See the Path a Flow Interview Took Before It Failed

	Can't recommend enough using Process Builder & Visual Workflow in tandem - Eliminates the need for many Apex trigger use cases I've seen.

* <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/rn_vf_static_resources_visualforce_domain_cruc.htm" target="_blank">Static Resources Served from the Visualforce Domain</a>

	Better make sure you're using $Resource URLFOR() in your code! It's best practice!
* <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2015/04/custom-metadata-types-ga.html" target="_blank">Custom Metadata Types</a>

### Lightning Components (still Beta)

	Now validating references in JavaScript as well as inherited references on compile.
    
    Suprisingly small amount of improvements for Lightning Components though... Maybe everyone was working on the new features that are written in Lightning :wink:

### Integration & Outlook

	Something else to manually deactivate for all the admins out there...

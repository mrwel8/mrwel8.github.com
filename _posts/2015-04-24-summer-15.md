<a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/salesforce_release_notes.htm" target="_blank">Summer '15 Release Notes</a> are out, so it's time to take a tour around the coolest new features!

> At the time of publication, this is only a "preview" of the release, and the features below may or may not be delivered.

### General Enhancements
* <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/rn_general_setup_assistant.htm" target="_blank">Setup Assistant for Newly Activated Organizations</a>

	Something else to manually deactivate for all the admins out there...

### Analytics (look for a future post on this...)

### Mobile 
* <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/rn_mobile_salesforce1_newfeat_actionbar_customization.htm" target="_blank">Customize Actions in the Salesforce1 Action Bar</a>

	This essentially differentiates the desktop Publisher bar on the Chatter feed from the Salesforce1 Action bar, although the actions are inherited from there.

title: Deciphering Email Size Limits
---





Having gone back and forth with Salesforce Technical Support a few times on the issue of email & attachment sizes, I wanted to provide some clarity on the 5, 10, and 25 MB numbers floating around the help docs. 

### Email-to-Case (Standard & On-Demand)
- Approx. 18 MB for all attachments

> 25 MB for the entire message, including headers and encoding

- No individual attachment size limit

### Outbound Email
- 10 MB for all attachments
- 5 MB per attachment

###

_## A recap of SFHackX ‘18_

> The room erupted in laughter as the loading screen for the GetZa app displayed a cat, spinning on top of a pizza, floating in space. That was when I realized how useful the hackathon would actually be to all the participants.

Last Saturday was the second annual hackathon for the Boston Salesforce Developer Group, and as a co-organizer and judge for the event, I had a chance to see first-hand all the inspiring work and learning that the teams put on display. Having experienced a few of these competitions now as both a participant and a contributor, a few highlights really stand out as best practices and helpful tips. I’m already looking forward to the next one and I hope you consider planning your own with the following playbook — You’ll find that it’s well worth the effort!

title: Thoughts on Wave
---


I had the chance back in November to go to New York for training on Salesforce's newest feature – Salesforce Analytics Cloud – and ever since, people have asked me:

_"What do you think about Wave?"_

In a nutshell, it's **awesome** :grin:

> The training was a 3-day "Brown Belt" course, which is the closest equivalent Salesforce currently has to an implementation expert certification... There's some more sessions going on right now, so ask your Account Executive or Partner Manager if you're interested!

### It's come a very long way since last November
Back in November, there were a lot of moments where you had to dig into code in order to import datasets, transform the data, or fully configure a dashboard. While you still have the option to use code to do all that, I'm happy to report that that's no longer the case!

As of the Summer '15 release, you can now:

* <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=bi_dataset_builder.htm&language=en_US" target="_blank">Build datasets from Salesforce data through a UI</a>
* <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/rn_bi_csv_preview.htm" target="_blank">Edit dataset metadata without editing JSON code</a>
* <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/rn_bi_wave_public_api.htm#rn_bi_wave_public_api" target="_blank">Access datasets through a REST API</a>
* <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer15/release-notes/rn_bi_embedded_dashboard.htm#rn_bi_embedded_dashboard" target="_blank">Add AC dashboards to Salesforce detail pages</a>

### It's now very much Salesforce-centric
When Analytics Cloud was first being marketed, Salesforce emphasized that any data, structured or unstructured, could be imported.

### The technology has been around for a while

### Salesforce has a lot of ideas in the roadmap
One giant advantage of being a <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000009xUI8EAM" target="_blank">Gold Partner</a> is that product managers sometimes give you glimpses into what is in the pipeline. Without going against any NDA or #safeharbor, all I can say is that Salesforce is putting a ton of effort into Analytics Cloud, so much so that their release timetable is actually doubled compared to the standard Winter/Spring/Summer schedule. The product team seems well aware of AC's shortcomings, and is already thinking through some really neat features for the near- and long-term future.

### It's more popular than you might think

### It's expensive, but likely worth it
Sure the numbers look pretty big on the Salesforce website, but think about what you're getting. Besides, there are some discounts going around right now that I can help you take advantage of :wink:

### It's actually "Salesforce Analytics Cloud, powered by Wave"
My guess is Benioff got a little too excited by the name at Dreamforce '14, and now everyone thinks it's "Salesforce Wave"... The giant inflatable surfboard made it all worth it though!

title: Thoughts on Wave
---


I had the chance back in November to go to New York for training on Salesforce's newest feature – Salesforce Analytics Cloud – and ever since, people have asked me:

_"What do you think about Wave?"_

In a nutshell, it's **awesome** :grin:

* It's come a very long way since last November. 
* The correct wording is actually "Salesforce Analytics Cloud, powered by Wave" – My guess is Benioff got a little too excited by the name at Dreamforce '14, and now everyone thinks it's "Salesforce Wave"...

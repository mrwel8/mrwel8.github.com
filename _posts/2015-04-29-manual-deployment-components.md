title: Manual Deployment Components
---

In keeping with the tradition of (hopefully) useful, but lengthy, lists, I've started compiling all the components that can't be migrated through Change Sets. 

Salesforce actually has a list of all the components that _can_ go through Change Sets, but the opposite is more helpful for planning deployments and knowing what can be done manually ahead of time.
